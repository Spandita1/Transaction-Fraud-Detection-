# Transaction Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a financial transaction is fraudulent or genuine using machine learning techniques.

## Objectives
- Detect fraudulent credit card transactions
- Analyze transaction behavior patterns
- Reduce financial losses using predictive analytics

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Workflow
1. Data preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature engineering
4. Model training
5. Fraud prediction

## Visualizations
The project includes hypothesis testing and visual analysis stored in the reports/figures folder.

## Result
The model successfully identifies suspicious transactions based on learned behavioral patterns.
